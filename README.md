The `docblock` package reads and parses documentation from C++ header files. 
It is opinionated and explicitly does *not* cover all edge cases of the C++ grammar, but hopes to provide sufficient utility for most use cases.
The `docblock` package is a pure Python package and depends only on `pyparsing`.
It can be installed as
```shell
pip install docblock
```
